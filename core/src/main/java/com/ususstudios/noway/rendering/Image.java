/** A class that holds data of {@link Texture}
 * {@link Texture} is not serializable, meaning if we want to save the game, we can't, it will throw an exception.
 * This class aims to solve that. Every instance of this class stores the image and also a {@link Texture} that can't be saved.
 * You can get the {@link Texture} using the {@code getImage} method.
 * An instance of this class is created using the {@code loadImage} method in the static version of this class, because the constructor is private.
 * It's private because this method uses a cache system which is more efficient than crating a bunch of new instances of this class **/
